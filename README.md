# Instant Rplay

#### **Instant Rplay** is an Android app that captures audio in the background, allowing quick access to previously recorded audio moments.
*Inspired by Nvidia's Instant Replay*

  - Display the expected storage size based on chosen parameters, helping you manage storage usage effectively.

- **Quick Save Button**: Save the last (available) 30 minutes of audio with a single click, or hold the button to select a specific time range to save.
